# Project Description

Project 1 provides analysis of a public microarray dataset. We reproduce results from comparisons of C3 and C4 tumor subtypes from Marisa et al. (2013). We normalized, filtered, and analyzed the data from 135 samples to discover relationships among them.

### project1_jia.R

Normalization of microarray data. Compute standard quality control metrics on normalized data and visualize the distribution of samples using Principal Component Analysis.

### konrad_analyst.R

Filters the gene expression matrix, performs hierarchial clustering, constructs a heatmap, and find differential gene expression between clusters with t-tests.
